abstract: >-
  Chronicals is a high-performance LLM fine-tuning framework achieving
  3.51x speedup over Unsloth through fused Triton kernels, Cut Cross-Entropy,
  LoRA+ optimization, and sequence packing. The framework provides complete
  mathematical foundations for each optimization with reproducible benchmarks.
